## ðŸ”§ Current Issue: Firebase Authentication Internal Error

**Problem**: Users are getting `[auth/internal-error] An internal error has occurred, please try again.` when trying to register.

**Root Cause**: Most likely the Firebase project doesn't have email/password authentication enabled.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps to Fix Authentication

### 1. Check Firebase Console Settings

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select project: `energyraise-de348`
3. Navigate to **Authentication > Sign-in method**
4. **Enable "Email/Password" provider**
5. Save changes

### 2. Verify Project Configuration

- Check if the project is in the correct region
- Verify there are no billing restrictions
- Ensure the project is not in a restricted organization

### 3. Test the Fix

- Run the app again
- Try to register with a new email/password
- Check console logs for Firebase connection status

## ðŸ“± Features Ready for Testing

Once authentication is fixed, these features should work:

- âœ… User registration with email verification
- âœ… User login
- âœ… Password reset
- âœ… User data storage in Firestore
- âœ… Profile image upload to Firebase Storage
- âœ… Authentication state management throughout the app

## ðŸ§ª Testing Checklist

- [ ] Firebase initialization successful
- [ ] User registration works
- [ ] Email verification sent
- [ ] User login works
- [ ] Password reset works
- [ ] User data saved to Firestore
- [ ] Authentication state persists across app restarts
